# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a complete example of classifying Iris flowers using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm with **scikit-learn**. It includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction on new samples, and data visualization using PCA.

---

## Features

- Loads the famous Iris dataset
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Scales features using `StandardScaler` for better KNN performance
- Trains a KNN classifier with Euclidean distance
- Evaluates model accuracy and prints detailed classification report
- Predicts classes of new flower samples
- Visualizes the dataset in 2D using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

 ```
 git clone https://https://github.com/NoorNick/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
 cd Iris-Flower-Classification
 ```

2.Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook or script:

If you use Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```
Then open Iris_flower_classification.ipynb and run the cells.

---
## Output Example
The notebook/script prints model accuracy, classification reports, predicted classes for new flowers, and shows a PCA scatter plot of the data.
